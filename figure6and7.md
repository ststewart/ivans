## Figure 6: 2D Example

<img src="_static/Fig6-G012-figure-DT-v2.png">

<b>Figure 6: 2D vapor plume expansion and collapse.</b> Example 2D cylindrically symmetric vapor plume evolution starting with ice-silica bodies colliding at 6 km s$^{-1}$. The surrounding nebular gas is dust-free at 0.1 Pa and 200 K. A. Initially the vapor plume is denser than the surrounding shocked nebula, indicated by the shell of hot gas bounded by the exterior nebular shock and the nebula-plume interface. The water vapor plume is cool with small amounts of hot silica gas. The principal direction of the vapor plume generates a much hotter nebular shock than the opposite direction. B. As the pressure and density drops in the vapor plume, turbulent eddies form at the nebula-plume interface. C. The inward turbulent flow mixes plume and nebular materials in a warm cloud about $10^4$ times greater in size than the original planetesimals. Note the change in scale at each time step. 

Each animation zooms out in space at regular time intervals as the vapor plume expands.

The very hot material in the plume is vaporized silica; these temperatures are unrealistic due to the lack of chemical mixing in the calculation.

There are tracer particles in the colliding bodies that help display the disruption of the bodies. The tracer particles in the nebula approximate the motion of tiny dust particles that are coupled to the flow field. The dots are concentrated in the nebular shock surrounding the plume.

The large difference in velocity between the principal plume direction and the opposite direction separates the highly shocked material from less shocked material.



## Figure 7: 3D Example

<b>Figure 7: 3D vapor plume expansion and collapse.</b> Example 3D vapor plume evolution starting with ice-silica bodies colliding at 6 km s$^{-1}$. The surrounding nebular gas is dust-free at $10^{-6}$ bars and 200 K. A. The principal direction of the vapor plume expands more rapidly than the solid fragments from the disrupted bodies. B. Solid fragments are in the cooler regions of shocked nebula. C. The inward turbulent flow in the principal direction mixed shocked nebula and plume debris far downrange from the largest fragments from the disrupted bodies. Note the change in scale at each time step.

This is a 3D calculation of a collision between two spheres. These animations display a cross section through the centers of the colliding bodies. Each animation zooms out in space at regular time intervals as the vapor plume expands.
