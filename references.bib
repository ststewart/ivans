The assumptions inherent in the different models are presented in this overview and their implications are discussed. The comparisons of the various models demonstrate that the predicted shock Hugoniots are in good agreement with published data despite the simplifying assumptions that are associated with the models. Averaging models are shown to be among the simplest methods to implement and result in the closest agreement with experimental data.}, number={1}, journal={Shock Waves}, author={Petel, Oren E. and Jetté, Francois X.}, year={2010}, month=feb, pages={73–83}, language={en} }

The dust is assumed to consist of small solid particles distributed continuously in a perfect gas. The dust’s inertia and its solid phase behaviour strongly influence the wave propagation. It is shown that increasing the mass fraction of the dust does not automatically decelerate the shock front. Whether the shock is faster or slower than in the dust free case, rather depends on the volume fraction of the dust. This holds true whether the piston is accelerated, is moving at constant speed or is decelerated.}, number={3}, journal={European Journal of Mechanics - B/Fluids}, author={Steiner, Helfried and Hirschler, Thomas}, year={2002}, month=jan, pages={371–380} }

The meteoritic and solar abundances of a few elements (e.g., noble gases, beryllium, boron, phosphorous, sulfur) are discussed in detail. The photospheric abundances give mass fractions of hydrogen (X = 0.7491), helium (Y = 0.2377), and heavy elements (Z = 0.0133), leading to Z/X = 0.0177, which is lower than the widely used Z/X = 0.0245 from previous compilations. Recent results from standard solar models considering helium and heavy-element settling imply that photospheric abundances and mass fractions are not equal to protosolar abundances (representative of solar system abundances). Protosolar elemental and isotopic abundances are derived from photospheric abundances by considering settling effects. Derived protosolar mass fractions are X0 = 0.7110, Y0 = 0.2741, and Z0 = 0.0149. The solar system and photospheric abundance tables are used to compute self-consistent sets of condensation temperatures for all elements.},
